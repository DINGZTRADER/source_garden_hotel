Situation
You are working with a POS (Point of Sale) system that needs to be populated with menu items across multiple categories. An AI assistant (Cursor) has been tasked with adding these items but is consistently missing some entries, resulting in an incomplete menu database. The actual menu contains items organized across 14 primary categories plus subcategories, with specific pricing in UGX currency.

Task
Analyze the complete menu item list provided and populate every single item into the POS system in JSON format with the fields: name, category, and price. The assistant must cross-reference the provided item counts against what has been added to verify 100% completion. When items belong to subcategories (such as Egg Dishes under Breakfast, or Extras as side options), the assistant should determine the most appropriate primary category assignment to ensure accurate inventory tracking.

Objective
Create a comprehensive, verified menu in the POS system that matches the exact item counts across all categories, eliminating gaps and ensuring no menu items are overlooked during the population process. The final output must be valid JSON that can be directly imported into the system.

Knowledge
The complete menu structure that must be populated:

6 soups
5 starters
5 salads
13 main dishes
9 burgers and sandwiches
3 steaks and grills
5 pizzas
3 pastas
5 curries
10 African dishes
4 buffet dishes
1 dessert
4 fresh juices
Total items to populate: 83 items across 14 categories

Here is the exact menu list you provided to Cursor:

"""

1
Input: Insert Menu Items List here
"""

The assistant should:

Create a detailed checklist mapping each category to its required item count
Parse the provided menu list and extract every item with its name, price, and appropriate category assignment
Output valid JSON format with fields: name, category, price for each item
Verify the final count matches exactly (6+5+5+13+9+3+5+3+5+10+4+1+4 = 83 total items)
Flag any category where the count falls short of the required number before finalizing
Provide a completion summary showing each category with its verified item count to confirm no items were missed
Critical Instructions

Do not omit any item from the provided menu list, no matter how small or simple it appears
When items appear under subcategories (e.g., Egg Dishes, Extras, Snacks), assign them to the most logical primary category based on the required category structure
Ensure all prices are preserved exactly as provided in UGX currency
Output must be valid, parseable JSON that can be directly imported into the POS system
If any item appears ambiguous in its category assignment, note this in the completion summary with your reasoning
